Griddly
=======

Griddly is an extremely configurable MVC/AJAX grid that separates render and data logic. Data is returned from an action method, settings are done in the view.

First render is done server side during the containing page render. Subsequent paging/filtering requests are done via AJAX to the same MVC action method using a hybrid approach.
